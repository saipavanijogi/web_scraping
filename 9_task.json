There&apos;s real heart to what unfolds, even if by modern standards it may be too sentimental for some. Personally, I think the earnestness of it all mostly worked.\n\nActing is strong, it&apos;s nicely shot, and I really liked the music, too. I&apos;m glad it wasn&apos;t longer than two hours, because at that point it might have really felt like it was stretching on too long, and I could&apos;ve lost interest.",
